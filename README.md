# Task Manager

This task manager developed with HTML, SCSS, and pure JavaScript (Vanilla JS), and I tried to do the best practices and generate clean codes as much as I could. I believe the project will be helpful and informative for the junior and mid-level front-end developers or everyone who wants to learn JavaScript and want to have a deeper understanding of it. Also, I tried to change the elements in the page, like React and other client-side rendering frameworks that can re-render screens without any reloading. So, This project can give a good understanding of how the client-side rendering frameworks work. If you like, you can cooperate in developing this project and adding new features or refactoring codes. <strong>Don't forget give star :)</strong>
